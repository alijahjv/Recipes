							<h3>Ingredients</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>24 pack Fiber One English Muffins</li>
								<li>2 16 oz packaged tubes Turkey Breakfast Sausage (Jennie-O)</li>
								<li>9 eggs</li>
								<li>9 egg whites</li>
								<li>1 cup milk</li>
								<li>salt and pepper optional</li>
								<li>24 cheese slices (we used 2% milk American Flavored Kraft Singles - 45 calories per slice)</li>
								<li>sliced tomato optional</li>

							</ul>

							<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Press the turkey sausage flat until it is completely covering the bottom of a standard size, un-greased cookie sheet- the kind with the rims. (see pic below)</li>
								<li>Bake for about 15 minutes, the sausage will pull from the sides and it should look browned.</li>
								<li>While the sausage is baking beat together the eggs and milk, I like to add a little salt and pepper to the eggs but this is optional. Pour the eggs in to another standard size cookie sheet, that has been lined with cooking spray. Carefully place the eggs in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the eggs are no longer runny.</li>
								<li>Cut the sausage and eggs in to 24 equal squares. Open an english muffin and add a slice of sausage, egg, and cheese to each one. Put each completed sandwich into a sandwich baggie and freeze. I put all the sandwiches into a cardboard box in my freezer to help prevent freezer burn.</li>
								<li>When ready to eat, remove from freezer and plastic baggie, wrap in a paper towel, and microwave for 1 min 30 seconds on defrost (30%) then turn over and microwave on high for another 1 to 1.5 minutes. (I like to throw one in the fridge the night before so it thaws overnight, then just microwave on high for 1 min 30 seconds).</li>
								<li>I sometimes like to add a slice of tomato to my sandwich for added flavor.</li>

							<h3>Ingredients</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>2 medium Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced small </li>
								<li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
								<li>1 small red onion, diced </li>
								<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
								<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided </li>
								<li>12 large eggs</li>
								<li>1/4 cup whole milk</li> 
								<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
								<li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese (about 6 ounces)</li>
								<li>12 (10- to 12-inch) flour tortillas, at room temperature</li>
								<li>Optional extras: salsa, cooked bacon, cooked sausage</li>

							</ul>

							<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
							<ol>
									<li>Heat the oven: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°F. Prepare space in the freezer for a baking sheet.</li>
									<li>Roast your vegetables: Combine the potatoes, peppers, and onions together in a medium bowl. Drizzle with the oil and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and toss to coat. Transfer to an even layer on a baking sheet and roast until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
									<li>Cook your eggs: While the veggies roast, whisk together the eggs, milk, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt until combined. Melt the butter in a 10-inch skillet (cast iron or nonstick would be ideal) over medium heat. Add the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly set but still moist, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
									<li>Assemble the burritos: Let the eggs and roasted vegetables cool while you set up an assembly station — the eggs and vegetables should be room temperature for best assembly. Tear off 12 squares of aluminum foil. Have your cheese and tortillas standing by. Place a tortilla on top of a piece of foil. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of cheese onto the tortilla. Top the cheese with 1/4 cup roasted vegetables, followed by 2 heaping tablespoons of the scrambled eggs, and any extra toppings.</li>
									<li>Fold the burritos: Roll the burrito tightly by folding the sides over the filling, then rolling from the bottom up.</li>
									<li>Wrap and freeze: Wrap the burrito tightly in the aluminum foil and repeat with filling and folding the remaining burritos. Freeze the burritos in a single layer on a baking sheet — they'll freeze faster and more uniformly this way. Store frozen burritos in a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag for longer-term freezing.</li>
									<li>To eat: Unwrap and microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until warmed through, or heat in a regular or toaster oven at 350°F for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>

									<li>Storage: Frozen burritos can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>

									<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spread a little bit of tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9×13 pan. Layer with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the spinach mixture, 1/4 of the tomato sauce, and 1/4 of the cheese. Repeat and pour 1/2 cup water over the two layers. Repeat once more, ending with noodles, sauce, and cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water over the whole thing again and cover tightly with oiled foil.</li>
									<li>Bake for 30-40 minutes; when the liquid is bubbling and the noodles have softened, remove the foil and bake uncovered for 10 more minutes. Let stand for 10-15 minutes before serving so that the lasagna noodles can soak up all the extra moisture.</li>

									<h3>Ingredients</h3>
									<ul>
											For Cauliflower Rice
											<li>1 head cauliflower</li>
											<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
											<li>salt</li>
											<li>pepper</li>
											For Buffalo Chicken and Broccoli
											<li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken thigh, cut into bite sized pieces about 1 pound of broccoli, cut into small to medium florets* (I used two large crowns)</li>
											<li>1 tablespoon oil (for the pan, optional)**</li>
											<li>¼ cup hot sauce (I used Frank's Red Hot)***</li>
											<li>2 Tablespoons butter****</li>
											<li>salt</li>
											<li>pepper</li>

									</ul>

									<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
									<ol>
										<h4>To make the Cauliflower Rice</h4>

										<li>Cut cauliflower into medium to small sized florets, removing the green leaves and any tough stem.</li>
										<li>Working in batches, place florets into the food processor and don't fill the bowl more than halfway. Pulse until the cauliflower resembles grains of rice, about 20 pulses. Try not to over process or you will have cauliflower mash!</li>
										<li>Heat a skillet or saute pan over medium heat with olive oil. Add cauliflower and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender 5-8 minutes.</li>

										<h4>To make the Buffalo Chicken and Broccoli</h4>

										<li>Heat a skillet or saute pan that has a lid over medium high heat. Add oil if using, and when hot add chicken. Season with just a little salt. allow to cook on one side until browned, then turn and brown the other side. Cook until no longer pink, 4-5 minutes per side.</li>
										<li>When chicken is cooked, add broccoli to the pan and cover. Allow to steam until tender 5-10 minutes. You can give the pan a stir a few times if you want to keep the chicken from browning too much. Broccoli is done when easily pierced with a knife and still bright green.</li>
										<li>Meanwhile, prepare the buffalo sauce. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter with the hot sauce and whisk to combine.</li>
										<li>Pour the sauce over the chicken and broccoli, toss to coat everything in the sauce.</li>
										<li>Serve over cauliflower rice or regular rice.</li>

										<h4>NOTES</h4>

										<p>* Make sure the broccoli florets are not too large and are of even size. This will allow them to cook faster and also make sure that they are all done at the same time.</p>
										<p>**If using a pan that is not non-stick, I would suggest using a little oil when cooking the chicken. Otherwise it may stick to the pan.</p>
										<p>***If you prefer more sauce, just increase the amount of hot sauce you use.This amount makes enough to fully coat everything but doesn't leave much extra sauce.</p>
										<p>****If paleo or whole 30, use coconut oil or ghee instead of butter</p>

									<p>Mashed cauliflower tastes similar to mashed potatoes but with fewer carbs and many more nutrients, including antioxidants and both vitamins C and K. We substituted them for taters in this low-carb “meat and potatoes” meal. The white veggie is so creamy it’ll fool even the cook. Top sirloin is one of the leanest cuts you can get, but lean doesn’t have to mean dry. These steaks are still flavorful and juicy — just be sure to not overcook them.</p>
							</section>
								<section class="content hide">
									<h3>Ingredients</h3>
									<ul>
											<li>2 3.5 ounce top sirloin steaks, at room temperature</li>
											<li>0.75 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
											<li>0.5 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
											<li>4 cups cauliflower florets</li>
											<li>2 tablespoons nonfat milk</li>
											<li>2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
											<li>1 small clove garlic</li>
											<li>6 cups spinach</li>

									</ul>

									<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
									<ol>
											<li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat and coat with cooking spray.</li>
											<li>Pat the steaks dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Place in the skillet and cook 3-6 minutes on each side, depending on how rare or well done you like it.</li>
											<li>Transfer the steaks to two plates, loosely tent with foil and let them rest.</li>
											<li>Place the cauliflower in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain thoroughly and transfer to a blender. Add milk, cheese and garlic; puree until smooth.</li>
											<li>Heat the same skillet to medium heat. Add spinach and sauté until soft, about 1 minute.</li>

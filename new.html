								<h3>Ingredients</h3>
								<ul>
										<li>6 demi baguettes (each about 8 inches long)</li>
										<li>24 large eggs</li>
										<li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
										<li>1 cup full-fat sour cream</li>
										<li>Olive oil</li>
										<li>12 ounces breakfast sausage, cooked and crumbled</li>
										<li>3 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
										<li>6 scallions, green and white parts thinly sliced, divided</li>

								</ul>

								<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
								<ol>
										<li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350°F.</li>

										<li>Cut a deep-V into the top of each baguette. Remove the tops and the soft interior of the bread, leaving no more than a half-inch on the bottom and sides of the baguettes (save the tops and interior for another use); set aside.</li>

										<li>Whisk together the eggs in a large bowl. Whisk in the sour cream and salt. Place the hollowed baguettes on a baking sheet. Use a brush to coat the outside of the bread with a thin layer of olive oil.</li>

										<li>Divide the sausage between the baguettes. Sprinkle about half of the cheese over the sausage. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the scallions, then sprinkle the remaining scallions over the sausage and cheese.</li>

										<li>Pour the egg mixture into each baguette, filling each not quite to the top. Be sure not to overfill the bread. You will not use all of the egg mixture at first. Allow the eggs to settle and soak into the bread, 1 to 2 minutes. Top off each baguette with more eggs as needed. Top each baguette with the remaining cheese and scallions.</li>

										<li>Bake until the eggs are set and golden-brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the sandwiches cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before cutting the loaves in half and serving.</li>

										<li>Reheating: If not serving immediately, allow the egg boats to cool completely. Cut each baguette in half and wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Store in resealable bags in the refrigerator or freezer. Reheat uncovered in a 325°F regular or toaster oven until warmed through, about 20 minutes if refrigerated, or about 30 minutes if frozen.</li>

										<li>Make ahead: The sausage can be cooked and stored in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days until you're ready to assemble the egg boats.</li>

										<li>Storage: The foil-wrapped egg boats can be stored in resealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>

							<p>By substituting scrambled egg whites for half the noodles in this mac and cheese recipe, we drastically cut the carbs and boost the protein count. The firm eggs feel and taste just like al dente pasta and the cheesy sauce really only has about one ounce of cheese — the creaminess comes from egg yolks. We love having a heaping scoop for breakfast with a little turkey bacon crumbled on top. It gives a whole new meaning to bacon and eggs!</p>

								<p>A veggie and a meat make up this morning treat! Spinach and eggs shaped as muffins, are baked in water so they will not toughen. Crispy potatoes are mixed in with ham, for a savory hash even worthy of Sam. Have it with a glass of orange juice, have it while reading Dr. Seuss. You will like green eggs and ham, especially since it’s only one calorie per gram.</p>

								<section class="content hide">
								<h3>Ingredients</h3>
								<ul>

									<li>12 silicon muffin liners</li>
									<li>10 ounces frozen spinach, thawed</li>
									<li>6 large eggs</li>
									<li>1 cup egg whites</li>
									<li>8 ounces reduced-fat cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
									<li>0.5 teaspoon baking powder</li>
									<li>0.25 teaspoon salt</li>
									<li>0.25 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
									<li>1 whole yellow onion, chopped</li>
									<li>16 ounces extra-lean cooked ham, cut into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
									<li>1 half red bell pepper, chopped</li>
									<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
									<li>1.5 pounds red baby potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>

								</ul>

								<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
								<ol>


									<li>    
									Preheat oven to 325° F and place the rack in the middle position. Boil 2 quarts of water in a kettle. Grease the insides of the muffin liners with oil and arrange them on a rimmed baking pan.</li>
									<li>Squeeze excess water out of the spinach and put it in a food processor or blender along with the eggs, egg whites, cheese, baking powder, salt and pepper. Pulse until mixture is an even green color with bits of spinach, about 30 seconds. Fill the muffin liners almost to the tops with the egg mixture.</li>
									<li>Place the baking pan on the middle oven rack and carefully pour the boiled water into the pan. Bake until firm in the centers, about 20-25 minutes. Place the potatoes in a microwave-safe dish, cover with plastic wrap and microwave at HIGH for 5 minutes. Uncover and cool slightly.</li>
									<li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray and add onions; sauté for 3 minutes or until translucent. Add ham and bell pepper; cook until ham is browned, about 3 minutes.</li>
									<li>Transfer the ham mixture to a bowl and set aside. Wipe the skillet clean and return heat to medium-high. Add olive oil, swirl to coat and add potatoes, cut-side down. Cook for 4 minutes without stirring. Turn potatoes over. </li><li>Cook for 6 minutes without stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in ham mixture until warmed up, about 2 minutes.</li>
									<li>Transfer muffin liners to a cooling rack to set for 5 minutes.</li>
									<li>Serve two muffins with a cup of home fries.</li>

								<h3>Ingredients</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>1 15 oz. can black beans**</li>
									<li>1 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
									<li>1/2 small red onion</li>
									<li>1 clove garlic</li>
									<li>1/4 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
									<li>2 cups shredded cheese</li>
									<li>1 batch taco seasoning</li>
									<li>10 taco sized tortillas</li>

								</ul>
								<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Drain the can of beans and rinse lightly. Place the beans in a large bowl along with the corn (no need to thaw).</li>
									<li>Rinse the cilantro, remove the leaves, and chop roughly. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the cilantro, onion, garlic, and shredded cheese to the bowl with the beans and corn. Lastly, mix up a batch of taco seasoning and add to the bowl. Stir everything until evenly mixed.</li>
									<li>Place a half cup of the filling on one side of each tortilla and fold over. Cook in a skillet on both sides over medium heat until brown and crispy and the cheesy filling has melted.</li>
									<li>To freeze the quesadillas, simply fill each one and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place in the freezer for one hour to solidify the quesadillas and then transfer to a freezer bag. To reheat either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat (make sure to use low heat so that the filling has time to thaw and melt before the outside burns).</li>
									<li>**I used black beans that I cooked from dry in my slow cooker using this <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/2010/12/how-to-kick-the-can-of-beans/">method</a>. It’s easy, requires almost no effort, and is about 1/3 the cost of a can of beans.</li>
